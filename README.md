HTTPLib
========

HTTPLib is an opinionated HTTP client library written in Rust that uses
the `surf` library in combination with Serde. 

It has been written out of the observation that I was writing 
very similar code for each project that involved an HTTP client.

The library is very much a work in progress and as such this README
will be updated in the near future.
